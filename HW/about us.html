About Us, Everything Horse
Equestrian news, event reports, articles, buyer guides, an online store AND classifieds
Launched in 2012 by Suzanne Ashton, Everything Horse has grown into an extensive equestrian source of information, boasting news coverage, articles, reviews, event results, an online store and even classifieds. The website continues to thrive with a loyal fanbase made up of horse enthusiasts and racing fans from the UK and beyond.

As of June 2023, we host over 5,000 equestrian-related articles!!

Welcome to Everything Horse, a group of equestrian websites built for horse owners and enthusiasts

Everything Horse Magazine, News and Reports
In October 2013, after a full year of success, our magazine division was created. After a period of publication, all the material was relocated to our website so readers could gain free access to any article, anytime. We offer publish content focussed on a variety of topics including horse health, rider, and horse training instructions, buyer guides, interviews, and tested and trusted material.

We really enjoy sharing equestrian news stories, reports, racing news and event results, which together, help our readers stay up to date with their favourite riders, brands and events.

You will often find an Everything Horse representative attending some of the largest equestrian events including Badminton Horse Trials, Burghley Horse Trials, Horse of the Year Show, London International … and the list goes on.

We literally ‘work our socks off’ to bring our readers the latest in breaking news and everything else ‘horsey’ related.
